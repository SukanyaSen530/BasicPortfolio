          I remember when I first came to know about Express Js, it was January 2021. I had taken a udemy course for full stack web development. Basically, it is a node framework, just like we use Jquery on top of vanilla JS for short and easy code writing. Now Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications in simple words more like low level programming, it interacts with machine more. Express reduces the node's repetitive code which we have to write in order to write apps.
         </p>
         <p>
           Did you know Express.js only requires javascript? It becomes easier for programmers and developers to build web applications and API without any effort. Since most of the code in prewritten in this framework, you just need to know how to use it.You can build a single page, multi-page, or hybrid web applications using Express.js. 
        </p>

          <ul>
            Now you may be thinking, there are many such framework, why should I choose Express? Let's get to it's features.
            <li><span>Faster Server side development</span> - Express.js provides many commonly used features of Node.js in the form of functions that can be readily used anywhere in the program. This removes the need to code for several hours and thus saves time.</li>
            <li><span>Middleware</span> - Middleware is a part of the program that has access to the database, client request, and the other middlewares. It is mainly responsible for the systematic organization of different functions of Express.js.</li>
            <li><span>Routing</span>
              ExpressJS provides a highly advanced routing mechanism which helps to preserve the state of the webpage with the help of their URLs.</li>
            <li><span>Templating</span> - ExpressJS provides templating engines that allow the developers to build dynamic content on the web pages by building HTML templates on the server-side.</li>
            <li><span>Debugging</span> - Debugging is crucial for the successful development of web applications. ExpressJS makes debugging easier by providing a debugging mechanism that has the ability to pinpoint the exact part of the web application which has bugs.</li>
        </ul>

          However, for you using this you must know HTML,CSS,JavaScript,NodeJs,MongoDB, then it would be easier to relate. For more details you can visite their oficial site -> <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Express Js</a>.
