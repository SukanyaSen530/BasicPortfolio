          Caution -- Now, this is not at all a technical Blog! I love sketching, I started to draw before even I joined School. But as I grew older, I did not have the time to draw a lot, all the assignments in college, fun with friends, exams, placement pressure, I had totally forgot about one hobby which made me happy, while doing it I could be myself, no fear of judgement(Oviously If I don't share on insta or pinterest).

           Recently, during this lockdown all I had was time! So, one fine Sunday I sat to draw and BOOM! I could not even draw a circle. No matter what you are good at, if you don't practice, you seem to lose interest and all the great stuff which you could do earlier, now seems difficult. So, what could I do to inspire myself or motivate myself for not giving up? Yes, you are right! Youtube it was. I used to follow some great artist in my college days, but one whose videos inpired me was KESH! Luckily, he had started his 100 days of sketching so I thought to give it a go along with him. He had a simple rule -- Draw for 6 minutes evryday! It does not matter what you draw, but the only thing which matters is showing up everyday, tricking the mind that yes you can do it. Overcoming the feeling of laziness! This stuck like a lightning to me. And not only sketching, you can apply this in daily work too.

          This, inspired me and yes I tried to show up eveyday, now I don't draw often but I will remember this lesson life long. It helped me to set goals which I thought I wouldn't be able to accomplish before. So, if you like to draw but are too scared to start or stopped it or whatever may be the reaon or hobby or dream, don't let it go. Work hard for it, at last you will say to yourself --- All this pain, hardwork, patience was worth it :)
